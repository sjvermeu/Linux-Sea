  <title>Log File Management</title>

  <section>
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>If the previous chapters are all read through, you'll most likely
    have successfully installed Gentoo Linux. However, managing your Linux
    system is only starting. Within this chapter, we go through how the
    various Linux services log events on your system and how you can properly
    manage these log files.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>System Logger</title>

    <para>The system logger is a service that allows for various software
    tools to log their events through a unified, standardized interface. For
    locally running software, these tools can log through the
    <filename>/dev/log</filename> socket. Services that run remotely can send
    their events through the network. For a general understanding of logging
    daemons, having to deal with remotely running software might bring us too
    far.</para>

    <section>
      <title>/dev/log</title>

      <para>The <filename>/dev/log</filename> socket is created by the system
      logger (which we have very briefly discussed previously) and is made
      writeable for everyone. That is to be expected, as there are many tools
      that will log through this socket. Every tool that wants to log through
      the system logger logs a single line at a time inside this socket. The
      system logger is listening "on the other side" of the socket and will
      process these log events.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Log Event Meta Information</title>

      <para>You will most likely never need to write your own tool that logs
      through the system logger, yet understanding how a log event is sent is
      vital if you want to manage your log files properly. The reason for this
      is because you will want to filter based on criticality and origin of
      the events, and these are passed on as part of the log event
      itself.</para>

      <para>When a tool wants to log an event, he needs to provide two
      additional fields:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>the facility where the event is about, and</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>the importance level of the event</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The <emphasis>facility</emphasis><indexterm>
          <primary>facility</primary>

          <secondary>syslog</secondary>
        </indexterm> defines the type of the program that is sending out the
      event. This allows the system logger to properly filter messages,
      possibly sending them into different log files. Example facilities are
      authpriv (security/authorization messages), cron (scheduling messages)
      and kern (kernel messages). A full list of facilities can be obtained
      through the syslog man page</para>

      <programlisting>~$ <command>man 3 syslog</command></programlisting>

      <para>The <emphasis>importance level</emphasis><indexterm>
          <primary>importance level</primary>

          <secondary>syslog</secondary>
        </indexterm> defines the criticality of the event. The set of
      supported importance levels is:</para>

      <table>
        <title>System logger importance levels</title>

        <tgroup cols="2">
          <tbody>
            <row>

              <entry>The system is unusable (no, this has nothing to do with
              <command>emerge</command>, Gentoo Portage' installation
              tool)</entry>
            </row>
          </tbody>
        </tgroup>
      </table>

      <para>Based on these two fields, log messages are then filtered by the
      system logger into one or more log files.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>System Logger Configuration</title>

      <para>How a system logger is configured depends on the system logger you
      use. In this book, I'll focus on the <command>syslog-ng</command>
      logger.</para>

      <para>The configuration file for syslog-ng is
      <filename>/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf</filename><indexterm>
          <primary>syslog-ng.conf</primary>
        </indexterm>. An example configuration is displayed below.</para>

      <programlisting>@version: 3.0
options {
  stats_freq(43200);
};

source src {
  unix-stream("/dev/log" max-connections(256));
  internal();
  file("/proc/kmsg");
};

destination messages { file("/var/log/messages"); };
destination cron { file("/var/log/cron.log"); };
destination auth { file("/var/log/auth.log"); };

filter f_messages { not facility(cron, auth, authpriv); };
filter f_cron { facility(cron); };
filter f_auth { facility(auth, authpriv); };

filter f_warnplus { level(warn, err, crit, emerg); };

log { source(src); filter(f_cron); filter(f_warnplus); destination(cron); };
log { source(src); filter(f_auth); destination(auth); };
log { source(src); filter(f_messages); destination(messages); };</programlisting>

      <para>It might be easy to read the configuration file from the bottom
      up.</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The log entries define where messages come from (source),
          which filters the system logger applies (filter) and where the
          resulting messages are stored in (destination)</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The filter entries define what the filters actually do. For
          instance, the filter f_warnplus only accepts events with an
          importance level of warn or higher.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The destination entries define where the events are stored in
          (the log files)</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The source entry defines where the system logger gets its
          messages from (which, in this case, is the /dev/log socket, the
          kernel message interface kmsg and its own internal logging)</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>This fairly simple example immediately shows how flexible the logs
      can work. There are many more interesting filters you can apply, such as
      match() to match regular expressions within the logged event and
      program() to match log events of a particular tool.</para>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Non-Syslog Log Files</title>

    <para>Many tools log through the system logger, but it is not a huge
    majority. Lots and lots of tools, server software and others have their
    own logging system. This makes it a bit more difficult to fully manage the
    log files properly. However, if you know where the log files are, then
    that's a start.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Xorg Logging</title>

      <para>The Xorg server stores it log file at
      <filename>/var/log/Xorg.0.log</filename>. The trailing 0 denotes that
      this is of the current/last start. The log file of the start before that
      is called <filename>Xorg.1.log</filename>, and so on.</para>

      <para>Xorg uses the following notations to identify the various
      criticality levels:</para>

      <programlisting>Markers: (--) probed, (**) from config file, (==) default setting,
   (++) from command line, (!!) notice, (II) informational,
   (WW) warning, (EE) error, (NI) not implemented, (??) unknown.</programlisting>

      <para>The Xorg server will automatically rotate the log files, by
      default 3 times, after which it will erase the oldest log file.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Gentoo Related Logs</title>

      <para>Gentoo Portage (and other Gentoo tools) have their own set of logs
      as well.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Package Installation Logs</title>

        <para>The package logs (known as elogs<indexterm>
            <primary>elog</primary>
          </indexterm>) as defined in the chapter on software management are
        stored in <filename>/var/log/portage/elog</filename>. The variables in
        <filename>/etc/make.conf</filename> that define the location and the
        logging aspects are:</para>

        <programlisting># Base directory for Portage logging
PORT_LOGDIR="/var/log/portage"
# Type of logging (save = separate log per installation)
PORTAGE_ELOG_SYSTEM="save"
# Log filter (what to log)
PORTAGE_ELOG_CLASSES="info warn error log"</programlisting>

        <para>Portage does not clean up old log files though, so we'll need to
        implement something for ourselves.</para>
      </section>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Maintaining Log Files with Logrotate</title>

    <para>Most tools do not offer log rotation or clean up by default. It is
    therefore recommended to implement some sort of log rotation for your
    files. An interesting tool to install for this purpose is
    <package>app-admin/logrotate</package><indexterm>
        <primary>logrotate</primary>
      </indexterm>. The tool is triggered by your system scheduler (cron) and
    is best configured by creating separate configuration files for your log
    files.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Installing Logrotate</title>

      <para>First, install logrotate:</para>

      <programlisting>~# <command>emerge logrotate</command></programlisting>

      <para>Next, make sure that it is scheduled to be ran every day. For
      instance, you can have a script called logrotate.cron inside
      <filename>/etc/cron.daily</filename> with the following content (Gentoo
      users will have this as part of the installation):</para>

      <programlisting>#!/bin/sh

/usr/sbin/logrotate /etc/logrotate.conf</programlisting>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Configuring Logrotate</title>

      <para>To configure logrotate, create configuration files inside
      /etc/logrotate.d. For instance, the following /etc/logrotate.d/syslog-ng
      helps us rotate the log files that we identified as part of the system
      logger configuration:</para>

      <programlisting>/var/log/messages /var/log/cron.log /var/log/auth.log {
  rotate 6
  monthly
  # It is ok if a log file is missing
  missingok
  # Only execute postrotate after all 3 log files are rotated
  # instead of after each log file
  sharedscripts
  # Commands to run after the rotation has occurred
  # This will instruct syslog-ng to reload its configuration
  # and log files
  postrotate 
    /etc/init.d/syslog-ng reload &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 || true
  endscript
}</programlisting>

      <para>The file informs logrotate that the mentioned log files are
      rotated 6 times on a monthly basis (so you keep 7 months of history).
      The tool will automatically rename the "old" log files by adding a date
      stamp to the filename. You can also instruct logrotate to compress the
      rotated log files or even move them to a different location.</para>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Maintaining Log Files with Cron</title>

    <para>Not all log files can be easily managed with logrotate. For
    instance, you might want to only remove log files that are older than 1
    month. This can be easily accomplished with a simple cron entry. For
    instance, <filename>/etc/cron.weekly/elog-cleanup</filename>:</para>

    <programlisting>#!/bin/sh

find /var/log/portage/elog -type f -mtime +30 -exec rm '{}' \;</programlisting>
