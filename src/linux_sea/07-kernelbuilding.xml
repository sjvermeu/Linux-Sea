  <title>Configuring a Linux Kernel</title>

  <section>
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>The Linux kernel is responsible for the majority of the hardware
    support. It contains the drivers to access and communicate with hardware.
    However, there are also quite some user-space tools required in order to
    successfully work with the hardware. For instance, support for printing
    inside the kernel is limited to support to the LPT printer port or USB,
    but the printer drivers themselves are user-space.</para>

    <para>Another example are scanners: inside the kernel, you need either USB
    or SCSI support, but there are no drivers for scanners themselves. Those
    are available in the user-space.</para>

    <para>Terms like <emphasis>user-space</emphasis><indexterm>
        <primary>user-space</primary>
      </indexterm> (everything running as a regular process or data found in
    non-kernel-reserved memory) and
    <emphasis>kernel-space</emphasis><indexterm>
        <primary>kernel-space</primary>
      </indexterm> (in-kernel tasks or data in kernel-reserved memory) are not
    that frequently used in documentation about applications, but for drivers,
    the distinction is quite important. Everything in kernel-space can have
    quite an impact to performance (it must be fully tuned and proofread by
    various developers before it is accepted). As such, if particular drivers
    can be made part of a user-space design (this is not often possible) it is
    preferred to make them user-space drivers.</para>

    <para>To support all the hardware in your system well, you first need to
    identify what hardware is inside your system. Then, you need to find the
    correct configurations inside the Linux kernel that match against the
    hardware. Before building the Linux kernel, you also need to include
    support for the non-hardware related features you need (such as filesystem
    support). Once the kernel is built, you can store it to disk and update
    the boot loader to use the new kernel. Finally, you install and configure
    the user-space tools needed to deal with your hardware.</para>

    <title>Obtaining Hardware Information</title>

    <section>
      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para>If you don't know what hardware is inside your system (and I'd be
      very surprised if you know all components, including vendor and type of
      your system) you will be glad to know Linux has quite some interesting
      tools to tell you what it found. The results of these tools are
      regardless of whether or not your kernel has support for these devices
      (although some small support is required, but most, if not all default
      kernels have this included).</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Device Information</title>

      <section>
        <title>Processor</title>

        <para>Information regarding the processor(s) in your system can be
        found inside the <filename>/proc/cpuinfo</filename><indexterm>
            <primary>cpuinfo</primary>
          </indexterm> file. This file is not a real file but a representation
        of what the Linux kernel finds in your system. In effect, every file
        in the <filename>/proc</filename> file system is a representation of
        the kernel's information and every time you read it it gives you the
        last known state.</para>

        <programlisting>$ <command>cat /proc/cpuinfo</command>
processor    : 0
vendor_id    : GenuineIntel
cpu family   : 6
model        : 13

               tm pbe nx est tm2
bogomips     : 1597.26
clflush size : 64</programlisting>

        <para>The information might overwhelm you - don't let it. The most
        interesting information here is the model name as it effectively tells
        you what brand and type of CPU this is. If you have multiple CPUs
        inside your system (or multiple cores) then you'll find multiple
        entries - one for each CPU / core.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Memory</title>

        <para>Similar to CPU information, you can view the information from
        the <filename>/proc/meminfo</filename><indexterm>
            <primary>meminfo</primary>
          </indexterm> file to obtain information regarding your memory. Or,
        you can use the <command>free</command> command to obtain the current
        memory usage statistics - including the total amount of memory your
        system has.</para>
      </section>

        <title>PCI Devices</title>

        <para>PCI device information can be obtained using the
        <command>lspci</command><indexterm>
            <primary>lspci</primary>
          </indexterm> tool. Just entering <command>lspci</command> already
        gives you a nice overview of the PCI devices found inside your system.
        I recommend to use <command>lspci -k</command> as it will also display
        which kernel drivers are already used to manage the PCI device:</para>

    <title>Configuring a Linux Kernel</title>

    <para>There are two ways you can configure a Linux kernel in Gentoo Linux.
    One is the easiest method, yet not 100% reliable regarding supported
    hardware: it is a script Gentoo provides that builds a Linux kernel with a
    generic configuration and lots of loadable modules to include as much
    hardware support as possible. It works well for standard setups (both
    hardware and system setup) but might fail for more complex systems. The
    second method is the most reliable - you configure everything manually
    yourself. If it fails, it's most likely your own fault.</para>

    <para>But before we focus on these methods, a small introduction to the
    Linux kernel modules administration-wise.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Kernel Modules</title>

      <para>The Linux kernel is a file loaded into memory by the boot loader.
      However, Linux supports loadable kernel modules.</para>

      <para>A <emphasis>Linux kernel module</emphasis><indexterm>
          <primary>kernel module</primary>
        </indexterm><indexterm>
          <primary>linux kernel module</primary>

          <see>kernel module</see>
        </indexterm> is a part of the Linux kernel which can be dynamically
      loaded and unloaded from memory. As such, it is possible to build a
      kernel which supports certain hardware, but doesn't load support for
      these modules until absolutely necessary.</para>

      <para>Kernel modules are often used for detachable devices (such as USB
      devices) but also for distributions who want to provide a kernel to
      their users regardless of the hardware these users own: during the
      boot-up sequence, the distribution will load the modules needed to
      support the hardware found and leave all other modules untouched.</para>

      <para>It is important to understand though that these modules are read
      from somewhere - you can't put the driver for your disk in a module and
      store that module on disk - the Linux kernel doesn't know what a disk is
      at that point and can therefore not find the module. Similar, don't put
      support for a particular file system (such as ext3) in a module and
      store that module on an ext3 file system.</para>

      <para>To be able to use kernel modules even though they might be
      required to access devices such as disks, you can create an intermediate
      root disk (<emphasis>initial root disk</emphasis><indexterm>
          <primary>initial root disk</primary>
        </indexterm> or <emphasis>initrd</emphasis><indexterm>
          <primary>initrd</primary>

          <see>initial root disk</see>
        </indexterm> or <emphasis>initial ram file system</emphasis><indexterm>
          <primary>initial ram file system</primary>
        </indexterm> or <emphasis>initramfs</emphasis><indexterm>
          <primary>initramfs</primary>

          <see>initial ram file system</see>
        </indexterm>). This contains the modules that might be needed in order
      to successfully boot the system. Support for the initrd or initramfs
      format is built in-kernel (in-kernel is the term denoting that support
      is not built as a kernel module but immediately made part of the Linux
      kernel image loaded by the boot loader).</para>

      <para>The boot loader itself is responsible for placing the initrd or
      initramfs in memory and informing the Linux kernel where the initial
      root disk/file system can be found.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Working with Modules</title>

        <para>The three most important commands to use for kernel modules
        manipulation are <command>lsmod</command>, <command>modprobe</command>
        and <command>rmmod</command>.</para>

        <para>To list the currently loaded modules, use
        <command>lsmod</command><indexterm>
            <primary>lsmod</primary>
          </indexterm>:</para>

        <para>The <command>lsmod</command> output gives you what modules are
        loaded, the size it takes in memory and how many/what other modules
        use it.</para>

        <para>To remove a loaded module, first ensure that the module is not
        used by any other module any more (i.e. the "Used by" listing should
        be empty in the <command>lsmod</command> output) and then use
        <command>rmmod</command><indexterm>
            <primary>rmmod</primary>
          </indexterm>:</para>

        <programlisting># <command>rmmod ipw2200</command></programlisting>

        <para>If you want to load a module in memory, you should use
        <command>modprobe</command><footnote>
            <para>There is another command called insmod - this tool is less
            intelligent than modprobe: it only attempts to load a kernel
            module given its file name and it doesn't try to load the
            prerequirement modules (modules can prerequire other
            modules).</para>
          </footnote><indexterm>
            <primary>modprobe</primary>
          </indexterm>:</para>

        <programlisting># <command>modprobe ipw2200</command></programlisting>

        <para>One of the advantages of using modules is that you can pass on
        additional options to a module, effectively changing its behaviour.
        But first some information on getting more information on
        modules.</para>

        <para>An interesting command is <command>modinfo</command><indexterm>
            <primary>modinfo</primary>
          </indexterm>, which displays information about a module. Although
        its output might seem cryptic, it nevertheless gives some interesting
        pointers to what options a module supports.</para>

        <para>The above example shows that the uvcvideo module uses the GPL
        license, is the USB Video Class driver, ... and supports parameters
        clock, nodrop, quirks, trace and timeout. Of course, it does not give
        you information what these parameters mean, but that is what you have
        <link xlink:href="http://www.google.com">Google</link> for,
        right?</para>

        <para>Anyway, suppose you want to load the uvcvideo module with the
        <parameter>nodrop=1</parameter> argument (you might be instructed to
        do so from a bugreport or forum posting). You can do this using
        modprobe:</para>

        <programlisting># <command>modprobe uvcvideo nodrop=1</command></programlisting>

        <para>This does not make the option permanent though: when you reboot,
        the module will be loaded in without this option. And repeatedly
        rmmod'ing the module just to load it again with a parameter is quite
        resource-intensive. The solution is to tell modprobe that a particular
        option should be set by default. This can be accomplished by setting
        the necessary directives in
        <filename>/etc/modprobe.conf</filename><indexterm>
            <primary>modprobe.conf</primary>
          </indexterm> or in a file inside the /etc/modprobe.d<indexterm>
            <primary>modprobe.d</primary>
          </indexterm> directory. The latter is more often used: people or
        projects create a file inside <filename>/etc/modprobe.d</filename>

        <title>Loading Modules</title>

        <para>By default, Linux will load the modules you need for your
        system. It relies on hardware detection (modern hardware always
        exposes information about itself on a standardized manner) combined
        with the drivers of the kernel modules, which describe for which
        hardware they are made (and which other modules they require). What
        happens then is that udev (we'll talk about udev in the next chapter)
        gets informed by the Linux kernel about new hardware being detected.
        Udev then triggers a modprobe for that hardware, and based on the
        module information, modprobe knows which module to load.</para>

        <para>The module information is generated by
        <command>depmod</command><indexterm>
            <primary>depmod</primary>
          </indexterm> when kernel modules are installed (copied) to a system.
        That's a "nice-to-know" item, because it will happen transparently for
        the user (you'll most likely never need to run
        <command>depmod</command> yourself).</para>

        <para>However, not all drivers know up-front which hardware they
        support (some hardware doesn't expose this information) or they
        collide with other drivers and, as a result, a system is configured
        not to autoload any module for that hardware. When you are in such a
        situation, you can still instruct your system to automatically load a
        particular kernel module at boot time. All you need to do is add the
        kernel module name to
        <filename>/etc/conf.d/modules</filename><indexterm>
            <primary>modules</primary>
          </indexterm>. The file is self-explanatory, but below you can find
        an example for auto-loading the ipw2200 module.</para>

        <programlisting>modules="ipw2200"</programlisting>

        <para>You can also ask your system not to automatically load a
        particular module. To accomplish this, add the kernel module name as a
        blacklist inside
        <filename>/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf</filename><indexterm>
            <primary>modprobe</primary>

            <secondary>blacklist</secondary>
          </indexterm></para>

        <programlisting>blacklist uvcvideo</programlisting>

        <para>Blacklisting a module doesn't mean that the module cannot be
        loaded any more. It means that the automated load, based on the
        hardware information, is disabled. In other words, the link between a
        hardware device id and the module is blacklisted. A manual
        <command>modprobe</command> will still do the trick, and if the
        hardware isn't managed by another module yet, then this module will
        handle the hardware device.</para>

      the configuration attempts to put all required device support
      in-kernel.</para>

      <para>To use genkernel, we first need to install it. As root, execute
      the following command (software installation is covered later in this
      book):</para>

      <programlisting># <command>emerge genkernel</command></programlisting>

      <para>The installation shouldn't take long. Once finished, run the

      source code is already installed - if Gentoo has been installed, this is
      already the case):</para>

      <programlisting># <command>genkernel all</command></programlisting>

      <para>Once finished, the script will have created the Linux kernel
      itself, the various modules and an initrd file containing the necessary
      modules that might be required to boot the system. The Linux kernel file
      and initial root disk are then used by the boot loader to boot up
      Linux.</para>

          <primary>kernel</primary>

          <secondary>configuring manually</secondary>
        </indexterm> can take a while, but the majority of time comes in the
      configuration of the kernel. Especially the first Linux kernel
      configuration might even take over an hour to complete because there are
      so many options to select (or deselect). Luckily, configurations can be
      saved and reused later on, so subsequent configurations will be much
      faster.</para>

      <para>Even more, Pappy McFae, a vivid Gentoo user, is providing kernel
      seeds to Gentoo users. A <emphasis>kernel seed</emphasis><indexterm>
          <primary>kernel seed</primary>
        </indexterm> is, in his words:</para>

      <blockquote>
        <para>[a part of a kernel configuration where] all the tough stuff has
        already been set up. The basics for a standard desktop system
        configuration, basic network operation, and other settings have been
        set for stable systemic usability. All you, the user, have left to do
        is to plug in the required hardware devices, and you have a functional
        kernel.</para>
      </blockquote>

      <para>His idea is really worth pursuing, so don't hesitate to take a
      look at <link
      xlink:href="http://www.kernel-seeds.org/">http://www.kernel-seeds.org/</link>.
      On the site, you can then navigate to your architecture (currently only
      x86 and x86_64 are supported), select the kernel tree you have installed
      (most likely gentoo if you have installed the gentoo-sources) and
      download the configuration file for the selected kernel version.</para>

      <para>Next, copy the configuration file to the kernel configuration
      location:</para>

      <programlisting># <command>cp /path/to/3.8.5-gentoo-r1-x86-07.config /usr/src/linux/.config</command></programlisting>

      <para>This will make sure that the kernel configuration utility uses the
      settings from the file as the "default".</para>

      <section>
        <title>Loading the Kernel Configuration Utility</title>

        <para>The Linux kernel provides its own configuration utility; if you
        go to the Linux source code and type in "make menuconfig" you'll be
        greeted with the index of the Linux kernel configuration:</para>

        <programlisting># <command>cd /usr/src/linux</command>
# <command>make menuconfig</command></programlisting>

        <note>
          <para>The visual representation (more specifically, the location of
          the menu entries) might be different on your system. The location of
          settings changes very often and chances are that the kernel version
          you are using is different from the one this chapter is based

        <para>This tool doesn't do much more than edit a configuration file
        called <filename>/usr/src/linux/.config</filename> so it will not
        reconfigure your current kernel setup. As such, I recommend you to try
        it out. If you want to be absolutely sure that you don't mess anything
        up, you can make a backup of the current configuration file prior to
        starting the menuconfig:</para>

          </indexterm>). These options are interesting if you are currently
        running a LiveCD or different distribution with a default distribution
        kernel (a fits-all kernel that uses kernel modules) as they will
        enable the drivers that are currently loaded (when you execute the
        commands) in the kernel configuration, giving a nice configuration to
        start from. This is especially true with Pappy's kernel seeds
        ;-)</para>

        <para>The <command>localmodconfig</command> enables the drivers as

        <para>You should understand that your current Linux kernel (the one

        its configuration file any more - it has been built using a particular
        configuration and will remain as-is.</para>

        <para>Configuring your own kernel is most likely a trial-and-error
        process: you configure a new kernel, boot it, play around and if
        you're not satisfied (or it doesn't boot at all), just reboot with the
        old kernel (having several kernels next to each other is not a
        problem).</para>

CONFIG_MODULES:

Kernel modules are small pieces of compiled code which can
be inserted in the running kernel, rather than being
permanently built into the kernel. You use the "modprobe"
tool to add (and sometimes remove) them. If you say Y here,
many parts of the kenel can be built as modules (by 
answering M instead of Y where indicated): this is most
useful for infrequently used options which are not required
for booting. For more information, see the man pages for
modprobe, lsmod, modinfo, insmod and rmmod.

If you say Y here, you will need to run "make
modules_install" to put the modules under /lib/modules/
where modprobe can find them (you may need to be root to do
this).

If unsure, say Y.

        <para>The system also has a search system. Press "/" and type in

        <para>The search results give you a one-liner explanation of the found
        results as well as where you can find the option (here: in the
        "General setup" tab). It also shows you when the option is selectable
        (when the configuration BROKEN is set, or when FRV is not selected -
        FRV is an architecture, just as x86 and SPARC are - so for a non-FRV

          almost all of them provide subsections. This is of course expected,

    <para>The make command reads in a specific configuration file (the
    Makefile) which contains the instructions for building the Linux kernel
    completely. This can take a while; when finished, the kernel image will be
    stored in (for x86 architecture) <filename>arch/i386/boot</filename> and
    is called <filename>bzImage</filename><indexterm>
        <primary>bzImage</primary>
      </indexterm>.</para>

    <para>Next, you need to install the kernel modules (if any) on your
    system. Type in <command>make modules_install</command> to have the
    <command>make</command> command automatically copy the kernel modules to
    the correct location
    (<filename>/lib/modules/</filename><emphasis><filename>kernelversion</filename></emphasis>):</para>

    <programlisting># <command>make modules_install</command></programlisting>

    <para>Finally, copy over the kernel image to the /boot location. If /boot
    is a separate partition (as it is on my system) which isn't automatically
    mounted, mount it first:</para>

    <programlisting># <command>mount /boot</command>
# <command>cp /usr/src/linux/arch/x86/boot/bzImage /boot/kernel-3.10.7</command></programlisting>

    <para>You can also use <command>make install</command> right after (or
    before) the <command>make modules_install</command> step. This will copy
    the kernel to <filename>/boot</filename>, calling it
    <filename>/boot/vmlinuz</filename>, copying the previous kernel to
    <filename>/boot/vmlinuz.old</filename>. If you rather have it not
    overwrite kernels, you can also first create a symbolic link
    <filename>/boot/vmlinuz</filename> pointing to the correct kernel (say
    <filename>/boot/vmlinuz-3.8.5</filename>). A make install will then save
    the new kernel (as a new file) and update the link instead, keeping the
    old kernel image available for future use. I actually recommend to either
    manually copy the kernel, or use the symbolic link approach.</para>

    <para>To safely support make install, do the following steps only
    once:</para>

    <programlisting># <command>cp /usr/src/linux/arch/x86/boot/bzImage /boot/vmlinuz-3.10.7</command>
# <command>cd /boot</command>
# <command>ln -s vmlinuz-3.10.7-r2 vmlinuz</command></programlisting>

      <title>Rebuilding a Kernel</title>

      <para>Suppose that you have successfully built a kernel and are happily
      working with it. At some point in time, you'll need to upgrade your
      kernel. Luckily, there is no reason to perform the above steps over and
      over again.</para>

      <para>Go to the source location of your new kernel sources (most likely,
      still <filename>/usr/src/linux</filename>) and get your current kernel
      configuration. If you've followed the above configuration directives,
      you'll have access to these settings in
      <filename>/proc/config.gz</filename><indexterm>
          <primary>config.gz</primary>
        </indexterm>:</para>

      <programlisting># <command>cd /usr/src/linux</command>
# <command>zcat /proc/config.gz &gt; .config</command></programlisting>

      <para>The <command>zcat</command> command will "load" your current
      kernel configuration into the <filename>.config</filename> file, which
      is the file used by the kernel building process to find the (new)
      configuration settings. Next, tell the kernel build tool to use this
      configuration as if it is your old(er) configuration. This will result
      in the build process to only ask for validation when new configuration
      items are found (in the new sources) that weren't available
      previously.</para>

      <programlisting># <command>make oldconfig</command></programlisting>

      <para>When this is finished, continue with the <command>make</command>
      and <command>make modules_install</command> commands, finishing off with
      the <command>mount</command> and copy commands to install the new kernel
      at the <filename>/boot</filename> location.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Initial ram file systems</title>

      <para>I have touched the concept of initrd and initramfs already in the
      earlier sections. Its purpose is clear: to offer the booting system the
      necessary tools, files, libraries and modules so that the boot process
      can be continued on a fully prepared (and all hardware properly
      detected) system.</para>

      <para>Although initrd might still be in use, most distributions nowadays
      suggest the use of initramfs. Whereas an initrd is a full device (for
      which you pass on an image), an initramfs is an archive that is
      extracted on an <emphasis>tmpfs</emphasis> file system. This offers more
      flexibility and less resource consumption within the kernel.</para>

      <para>To generate an initial ram file system, I recommend that you use
      the <command>genkernel</command> application (even if you configured and
      build your kernel manually). Its usage is quite simple:</para>

      <programlisting># <command>genkernel --install --lvm initramfs</command></programlisting>

      <para>When <command>genkernel</command> has built its initial ram file
      system archive, you will find it in the <filename>/boot</filename>
      location, cleverly named starting with
      <filename>initramfs-</filename>.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Configuring the Boot Loader</title>

    <para>Before you can use the new kernel, you need to edit your boot loader
    configuration to use the new kernel. The bootloader I recommend is
    GRUB<indexterm>
        <primary>GRUB</primary>
      </indexterm>, the GRand Unified Bootloader, but others exist (especially
    for non-x86 compatible architectures which might need different boot
    loaders). In this section, I'll focus on GRUB2 (the previous GRUB,
    nowadays called GRUB Legacy, is no longer maintained).</para>

    <section>
      <title>Installing GRUB</title>

      <para>Before you can start using GRUB, you need to install GRUB onto
      your MBR<indexterm>
          <primary>MBR</primary>
        </indexterm>, or Master Boot Record<indexterm>
          <primary>Master Boot Record</primary>
        </indexterm>. That is a special location on your disk (the first 512
      bytes of a disk) which is loaded by the BIOS and executed (if it
      contains executable material).</para>

      <para>By installing GRUB into the MBR, GRUB is automatically started
      after the BIOS POST processing (Power On Self Test).</para>

      <para>First of all, you need to install GRUB2:</para>

      <programlisting># <command>emerge grub:2</command></programlisting>

      <para>Next, we install GRUB onto the MBR:</para>

      <programlisting># <command>grub2-install /dev/sda</command></programlisting>

      <para>If the disk is not configured with sufficient space after the MBR
      but before the first partition, you will need to force the installation.
      GRUB2 will use a special support mode in that case:</para>

      <programlisting># <command>grub2-install -f /dev/sda</command></programlisting>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Configuring GRUB</title>

      <para>Unlike GRUB Legacy, GRUB2 is configured through variables in
      /etc/default/grub, which are used to auto-generate the configuration
      file.</para>

      <programlisting># <command>nano -w /etc/default/grub</command></programlisting>

      <para>The variable that, if you need to set anything, is the most likely
      candidate, is GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX. This variable content is added to the
      kernel line and is used to pass on additional kernel parameters. For
      instance, to pass on the parameter "dolvm" (to support a logical volume
      as root file system, needed for some init scripts):</para>

      <programlisting>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="dolvm"</programlisting>

      <para>In most cases though, you will not need to set anything. For
      instance the root file system, which needed to be set individually in
      the past, is automatically detected by the GRUB2 configuration
      command.</para>

      <para>So, let's generate the configuration file:</para>

      <important>
        <para>Make sure that the output of the command shows that linux (and
        perhaps initrd) images are detected. If none are detected, then GRUB
        will not be able to boot the system as it has not found a Linux kernel
        to boot with.</para>
      </important>

      <programlisting># <command>grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg</command>
Generating grub.cfg ...
Found linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.10.7
Found initrd image: /boot/initramfs-genkernel-x86_64-3.10.7
done</programlisting>

      <para>That's it - GRUB is now installed and configured.</para>

    <title>Troubleshooting Boot Failures</title>

    <para>One of the worst issues you can face is an unbootable system. Yes,
    it is bad, because without being able to boot, how can you fix the system
    (or debug / troubleshoot)? Before continuing with the most frequent boot
    failures (and how to deal with them), first a quick look at how to
    generally act when a system fails to boot...</para>

    <section>
      <title>When a system fails to boot...</title>

      <para>A boot failure can either be due to:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>kernel configuration issue, or</para>

          <para>hardware malfunction</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>It's pretty easy to guess which one is the hardest to detect but
      easiest to resolve (hint: it's the hardware malfunction one). The other
      ones, well, they require a bit preparation in order to easily
      troubleshoot and, eventually, solve.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Kernel Parameters</title>

        <para>GRUB allows you to boot a kernel / system with a modified set of
        parameters for a single time (i.e. the changes are not persisted).
        This allows you to (re)boot a kernel with additional
        parameters.</para>

        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>When you are at the GRUB screen, highlight the entry you
            want to boot, and press <command>e</command> (for edit).</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Highlight the line starting with "kernel", and press
            <command>e</command> again.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Edit the line accordingly (a kernel parameter is often a
            word or key=value set appended to the line), and press Enter to
            save the changes (remember, it is just for this single
            boot)</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Press <command>b</command> (for boot) to boot the
            kernel.</para>
          </listitem>
        </orderedlist>

        <para>You will find that several of the kernel boot failures can be
        helped with one or more kernel parameters being added.</para>

        <title>Rescue Live Linux Environment</title>

        <para>If a system fails to boot due to a system configuration issue, I
        recommend to boot from a rescue environment (<link
        xlink:href="http://www.sysresccd.org">SysRescCD</link> comes to mind).
        Since USB sticks are widely spread and easy to work with, I suggest
        that you configure your system to be able to boot from USB
        <emphasis>and test it</emphasis>. It is faster than booting from most
        CD/DVD drives (sorry, I still don't have a BlueRay drive at the time
        of writing) and a rescue USB stick is easier to carry with you.</para>

        <para>Having a rescue live Linux environment around you is really
        worth it. Configuration failures are easily made, and can have serious
        consequences. Gentoo Linux doesn't have a roll-back scenario (yet)
        that allows you to boot with previous settings.</para>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Kernel Boot Failures</title>

      <para>Kernel boot failures can have multiple causes, but usually the
      output on the screen allows you to identify the issue rapidly.</para>

      <section>
        <title>ACPI Issues</title>

        <para>ACPI is a common source of boot failures. It isn't that the
        (ACPI) standard is bad, or that Linux drivers often implement it
        wrongly. Rather, some hardware is known not to follow the ACPI
        standard to the letter, making it difficult to write drivers that
        comply to the ACPI standard with this hardware.</para>

        <para>Issues with ACPI support are often seen through kernel oops
        messages (which is a dump to the screen offering information for
        kernel developers regarding the problem) that point to
        <function>acpi_*</function> functions:</para>

        <programlisting><emphasis>[     0.873537]  [&lt;ffffffff8134ecba&gt;] ? acpi_video_register+0x3f/0x71</emphasis>

        <para>Whenever you suspect that ACPI is the source of your issue, boot
        the same kernel, but with the <parameter>noacpi</parameter><indexterm>
            <primary>noacpi</primary>
          </indexterm> parameter.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Unable to mount root-fs</title>

        <para>Most likely one of the most occurring issue (but once you solved
        it, you most likely are never going to see it again):</para>

        <programlisting>Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)</programlisting>

        <para>or</para>

        <programlisting>VFS: Cannot open root device "sda3" or unknown-block(8,3)
Please append a correct "root=" boot option; here are the available partitions:
  sda driver: sd
    sda1 sda2</programlisting>

        <para>The digits "0,0" or "8,3" can be different in your case - it
        refers to the device that the kernel tries to access (and which
        fails). Generally speaking one can say that, if the first digit is 0,
        then the kernel is unable to identify the hardware. If it is another
        digit (like 8), it is unable to identify the file system (but is able
        to access the hardware).</para>

        <para>The problem here is that the kernel that you are booting cannot
        translate the "root=/dev/..." parameter you gave it (inside the boot
        loader configuration) into a real, accessible file system. Several
        reasons can result in such a failure:</para>

            <para>One of the most frequent cases: you selected support for
            your harddisk controller protocol (IDE, SATA, SCSI, ...) but

            <para>This isn't as stupid as it sounds. When you are booted with
            one kernel, it might list your disks as being /dev/sda whereas
            your (configured) kernel is expecting it to be /dev/hda. This is
            not because kernels are inconsistent with each other, but because
            of the drivers used: older drivers use the hda syntax, newer

            if you misselected a partition (in the example given at the
            beginning of this section, only two partitions are found whereas
            the kernel was instructed to boot the third). If it doesn't, it is
            most likely because the kernel doesn't know the device to begin

      <title>System Boot Failures</title>

      <para>The following set of subsections explain various failures you
      might get in contact with. These failures are less (or not) related with
      the kernel build process, but since they occur at boot-time (and due to
      lack of a better location in this book) I've included them in this
      chapter...</para>

      <section>
        <title>X (graphical environment) comes up, but keyboard or mouse
        doesn't work</title>

        <para>You might have this issue when you have just upgraded your
        graphical environment or HAL process. By itself not a very easy thing
        to debug, but you'll need to get access to your system, and rebooting
        doesn't help (as you'll get into the same situation anyhow).</para>

        <para>Luckily, you can ask Gentoo to boot the system without starting
        the graphical environment (leaving you with the command-line login
        from which you can fix things). Reboot until you get into the GRUB
        menu. Then press e(dit) on the boot item, e(dit) again on the kernel
        line, and add "nox" at the end of the line. This option will inform
        Gentoo not to load X.</para>

        <para>Now that you are booted without the graphical environment, you
        can fix your system.</para>

        <para>One reason this might happen is that X has been upgraded but you
